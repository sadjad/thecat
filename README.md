The Cat: Steal, Upload, Run!

The Cat steals some important files (like SMS DB, call history, Mac OS X keychain) from iTunes Backup of a Mac user and uploads them to an FTP server. It was made just for fun, and only used not for fun one time :).

Though the Python code might not be useful itself, you can embed it in a C/C++ program and hide it from ordinary users.
